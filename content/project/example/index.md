title: Pick and Place using 3D deep object pose estimation with YuMi Cobot

summary: Performing pick and place tasks with YuMi cobot with vision-based perception in the loop Trained the deep neural network with fully synthetically generated data and labels using Isaac Sim Utilizing ROS and customized drivers for controlling the YuMi including the end effectors Extended to industrial robot platform ABB IRB-4600 Using domain randomization to robustify the vision algorithm against edge cases including change of lighting, texture, color and etc.
