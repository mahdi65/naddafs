title: Pick and Place using 3D deep object pose estimation with YuMi Cobot
summary: 
  + Performing pick and place tasks with YuMi cobot with vision-based perception in the loop

  + Trained the deep neural network with fully synthetically generated data and labels using Isaac Sim

  + Utilizing ROS and customized drivers for controlling the YuMi including the end effectors

  + Extended to industrial robot platform ABB IRB-4600 

  + Using domain randomization to robustify the vision algorithm against edge cases including change of lighting, texture, color and etc.
