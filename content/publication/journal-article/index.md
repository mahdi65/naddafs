abstract: Pavement condition evaluation is essential to time the preventative or rehabilitative actions and control distress propagation. Failing to conduct timely evaluations can lead to severe structural and financial loss of the infrastructure and complete reconstructions. Automated computer-aided surveying measures can provide a database of road damage patterns and their locations. This database can be utilized for timely road re-pairs to gain the minimum cost of maintenance and the asphalt's maximum durability. This paper introduces a deep learning-based surveying scheme to analyze the image-based distress data in real-time. A database consisting of a diverse population of crack distress types such as longitudinal, transverse, and alligator cracks, photographed using mobile-device is used. Then, a family of efficient and scalable models that are tuned for pavement crack detection is trained. Proposed models â€¦
